# Python - Variable Annotations

## Variable Annotations

Variable annotations are a way to specify the type of a variable in Python. They are not enforced by the Python interpreter, but they can be used by external tools to check the types of variables.

Variable annotations are specified using the `:` operator. For example, to specify that a variable is an integer, you can use the following syntax:

```python

x: int = 10

```

In this example, the variable `x` is annotated as an integer. This means that external tools can check that `x` is an integer, but the Python interpreter will not enforce this.

Variable annotations can also be used to specify the type of a function's arguments and return value. For example, to specify that a function takes an integer argument and returns a string, you can use the following syntax:

```python

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

```

In this example, the `greet` function is annotated as taking a string argument and returning a string. This means that external tools can check that the function is used correctly, but the Python interpreter will not enforce this.

Variable annotations are a powerful tool for documenting code and catching errors early. They can be used to specify the types of variables, function arguments, and return values, and can be used by external tools to check that the code is used correctly.
